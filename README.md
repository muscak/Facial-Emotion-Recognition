Recent research suggests that a significant portion, approximately 55%, of emotional communication primarily relies on facial expressions and other visual cues [1]. Hence, developing a model that precisely recognizes facial emotions represents a major advancement in equipping AI-powered machines with emotional intelligence. Automated facial expression recognition systems offer vast potential across diverse applications, spanning from understanding human behavior and identifying mental health conditions to improving virtual assistants for customer-centric businesses. It’s also important for Emotion Recognition for Human-Robot Interaction [2]. Using Deep Learning and AI techniques to create a computer vision mode that can accurately detect facial emotion is an important step towards the development of emotionally intelligent machines powered by AI. CNN has been extensively used in diverse computer vision applications, including FER. At the beginning of the 21st century, several studies in the Facial Expression Recognition (FER) literature found that the CNN is robust to face location changes and scale variations and behaves better than the multilayer perceptron (MLP) in the case of previously unseen face pose variations [3].

The objective of this project involves leveraging Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence methodologies to develop a computer vision model. This model aims to precisely identify emotions in facial expressions by performing multi-class classification on images of faces, effectively associating each expression with its corresponding emotion.

You may see some of the example images for each emotion from the training set below. 

Exact number of images for each set and for each emotion can be seen in Checking Distribution of Classes section.`
